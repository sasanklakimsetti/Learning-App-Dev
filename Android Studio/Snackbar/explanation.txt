Snackbar: a class which helps in adding functionalities to a popup message

Bundle is a class which helps to store the previous message when we refresh/ undo

AppCompatActivity is a class which is used to connect an xml and kt file.

We actually connect the xml and kt file using a id of the kt file class to the xml file. But if we use DataBinding, then there is no need to using the id to connect files.

lateinit : initialize later i.e. if any variable is declared with this keyword, the variable is just declared but not initialized and can be initialised later

savedInstanceState: comes under the Bundle class
savedInstanceState: Bundle? -> before this the Bundle class is empty and nothing is stored in previous

inflate: helps to bind the xml file with kt file
layoutInflater: connecting the layout used in xml file with kt file

setContentView: the layout/ view created inside  the xml file will display.
setContentView(binding.root): show the view from the bottom to top

Snackbar.make(binding.root,text,duration): creates a snackbar instance with some message at the bottom of the screen. 'mae' property comes under the snackbar class

Snackbar.setTextColor(Color.parseColor()): sets the color to the text of the snackbar

snackbar.setAction("UNDO") {
                // Action to perform on undo
                Snackbar.make(binding.root, "Action undone", Snackbar.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            }.setActionTextColor(Color.parseColor("#00FF00"))

* sets an action the button inside the snackbar, .make() will describe what needs to be displayed/ popup after clicking on the button inside the snackbar and customising the color of the text inside the snackbar with setActionTextColor()
