Splash Screen: it is the first screen of an app which appears when we open an app for a specific amount of time we set.

We need to create a new activity SplashScreen by right clicking on layout->new->activity->empty views

Add any image into drawable to show on the start of application


go to Manifest file-> cut the present intent-filter and paste it in  activity where the name is SplashScreen and set exported to true

Just make changes in SplashScreen.kt and activity_splash_screen.xml and Manifest

No need of any change in activity_main.xml and MainAcitivity.kt
